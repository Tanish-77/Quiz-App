# Quiz-App

Create a Quiz Application Using JavaScript. 
-> we will learn how to create a quiz application using JavaScript. The quiz application will contain questions followed by a total score shown at the end of the quiz. The score will increase based on the correct answers given.

Prerequisites:
->HTML
->CSS
->JavaScript

Approach:
->Create a project workspace with three different files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the HTML file, the structure of the quiz application will be defined using different HTML tags like div, paragraph, heading, buttons, etc.

->The second file will be for CSS, In which the HTML elements will be grabbed using their IDs and Classes and styled accordingly with the help of CSS properties.
Now, the final file will be created for JavaScript. In this file, the whole logic of our quiz application will be defined by grabbing the elements with the help of DOM.
Next, an API will be called using the fetch method with some callback functions to manage the fetched data into different states like loading, failed, and success.
The button element will be grabbed and click event will be added to it, so that it loads the next quetion on the user screen once user clicks it.
